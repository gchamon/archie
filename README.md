## 1. Topics

These are the topics included in this handbook.

### [System installation guide](./GUIDE.md)

The system installation guide documents necessary steps to get archie up and running, so start [here](./GUIDE.md)!

### 5.1 [Keyboard shortcuts](./KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md)

[Keyboard shortcuts](KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md) documents all the possible keyboard
shortcuts. The information is extracted from hyprland configuration using
[Google's Gemini LLM](https://gemini.google.com).

### 5.2 [Keyboard customizations](./KEYBOARD_CUSTOMIZATIONS.md)

[Keyboard customizations](KEYBOARD_CUSTOMIZATIONS.md) documents the deployment
of xkeyboard-config compatible customizations that makes it easier to type in a
different language than that of the keyboard in use.

### 5.3 [Backup and Restore](./BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md)

The [Backup and Restore](BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md) guide isn't intended to be
generally applicable outside my personal environment. It's there for my
personal disaster recovery drills, but could inspire others looking for backup
strategies.

### 5.4 [Development](./DEVELOPMENT.md)

[This document](DEVELOPMENT.md) explains steps to install and configure
tools I need for daily work as a developer.
