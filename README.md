## Topics

These are the topics included in this handbook.

### [System installation guide](docs/GUIDE.md)

The system installation guide documents necessary steps to get archie up and running, so start [here](docs/GUIDE.md)!

### [Keyboard shortcuts](docs/KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md)

[Keyboard shortcuts](docs/KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md) documents all the possible keyboard
shortcuts. The information is extracted from hyprland configuration using
[Google's Gemini LLM](https/gemini.google.com).

### [Keyboard customizations](docs/KEYBOARD_CUSTOMIZATIONS.md)

[Keyboard customizations](docs/KEYBOARD_CUSTOMIZATIONS.md) documents the deployment

different language than that of the keyboard in use.

### [Backup and Restore](docs/BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md)

The [Backup and Restore](docs/BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md) guide isn't intended to be
generally applicable outside my personal environment. It's there for my
personal disaster recovery drills, but could inspire others looking for backup
strategies.

### [Development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)

[This document](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) explains steps to install and configure
tools I need for daily work as a developer.
