This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying Hyprland to an Arch
Linux installation, including package installation, theming, configuration, and
backup restoration.

This is intended for single user devices, personal devices that aren't going to
be shared by multiple linux users.

Up to section [4. System Configuration](#4-system-configuration) the guide is
supposed to be system and backup agnostic and should work in any system.

## 1. Initial Setup

### 1.0 Installing Arch Linux

This guide isn't prescriptive about how to install Arch Linux, but it requires
the installation of the desktop profile with hyprland by using
[archinstall](https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall).

### 1.1 Install Essential Packages

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
```

### 1.2 Install Yay (AUR Helper)

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git
cd yay-bin
makepkg -si
cd ..
rm -rf yay-bin
yay -S yay
yay -Scc
```

### 1.3 Install Essential Packages with Yay

Install the following packages using `yay`:

```bash
yay -S --needed \
  acpi \
  bc \
  bind \
  blueman \
  brightnessctl \
  cliphist \
  dunst \
  fd \
  frece \
  fzf \
  gnome-system-monitor \
  grimblast-git \
  hyprcursor \
  hyprlock \
  hyprpaper \
  inotify-tools \
  jq \
  kdeconnect \
  ksnip \
  less \
  lsd \
  man-db \
  ncdu \
  noto-fonts \
  noto-fonts-emoji \
  otf-font-awesome \
  pamixer \
  pavucontrol \
  plocate \
  rofi-wayland \
  rsync \
  unzip \
  waybar \
  wl-clip-persist \
  xorg-xhost \
  zen-browser-bin \
  zip \
  zsh-fast-syntax-highlighting
```

### 1.3 Install Development Packages for LazyVim

Install these language-specific packages:

```bash
yay -S --needed \
  go \
  neovim \
  npm \
  pyenv \
  rust
```

[Install nix](https://nixos.org/download/#nix-install-linux) in single user mode:

```bash
sh <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --no-daemon
```

It's more convenient to install from nix official scripts than with arch native
package manager to avoid permission issues in neovim.

---

## 2. Deploying system config

Clone this repo and deploy it to `~/.config`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gchamon/archlinux-system-config
rsync -va ~/archlinux-system-config/ ~/.config
rm -rf ~/archlinux-system-config
```

### 2.1 System specific configuration

System specific configurations reside in `~/.config/hypr/config`. To deploy the
configuration, copy the default distribution file and change it:

```bash
cp ~/.config/hypr/config/device.dist.conf ~/.config/hypr/config/device.conf
$EDITOR ~/.config/hypr/config/device.conf
hyprctl reload
```

#### Customization of device-specific configs

For `brightnessctl` to work, use `$backlightDevice` to configure which device
`brightnessctl` should use to control brightness.

To get a list of the available devices, run:

```bash
ls -1 /sys/class/backlight/
```

If none is available, you should try using `linux-lts` kernel and play around
with `acpi_backlight` kernel parameter. For more information see [ACPI
backlight control](#acpi-backlight-control) and archlinux docs on [Backlight's
kernel command-line
options](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Backlight#Kernel_command-line_options).

### 2.2 Deploy oh-my-zsh

Zsh shell relies on `oh-my-zsh` and `powerlevel10k`, which will need to be installed:

```bash
yay -S --needed \
  zsh \
  zsh-completions \
  oh-my-zsh-git \
  zsh-theme-powerlevel10k \
  ttf-meslo-nerd

test -f ~/.zshrc && mv ~/.zshrc{,.bk}
ln -s ~/.config/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

There are four preconfigured powerlevel10k prompt styles. Choose one of
`.p10k-classic.zsh`, `.p10k-lean.zsh`, `.p10k-pure.zsh` or `.p10k-rainbow.zsh`
and create a symbolic link to `~/.p10k.zsh`:

```bash
ln -s ~/.config/.p10k-classic.zsh ~/.p10k.zsh
```

There is a fifth powerlevel10k prompt style that is geared towards supporting
tty shells, which is called `.p10k-portable.zsh` and it should be deployed to
the home folder along with the chosen profile:

```bash
ln -s ~/.config/.p10k-portable.zsh ~/.p10k-portable.zsh
```

Now change the shell to `zsh` if necessary:

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

### 2.3 Add required home folders

This is for the screenshot utility to work.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Pictures/Screenshots
```

---

## 3. Theming

### 3.1 Install Theme Packages

```bash
yay -S --needed \
  archlinux-wallpaper \
  gnome-themes-extra \
  qt5-graphicaleffects \
  xcursor-breeze5
```

### 3.2 SDDM Theme (Slice 1.5.1)

Unfortunately the main branch of the slice theme repo isn't compatible with
SDDM, making it impossible to just install `sddm-slice-git`. You must download
and extract the tar archive related to the [v1.5.1
release](https://github.com/EricKotato/sddm-slice/releases/tag/1.5.1) and
deploy it to `/usr/share/sddm/themes/slice` manually.

1. Download the [SDDM Slice theme v1.5.1](https://github.com/EricKotato/sddm-slice/releases/tag/1.5.1).
2. Deploy to SDDM themes directory:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
tar -xzvf sddm-slice-1.5.1.tar.gz
sudo mv sddm-slice-1.5.1 /usr/share/sddm/themes/slice
```

3. Configure sddm theme:

```bash
cat > /tmp/theme.conf <<EOF
[Theme]
Current=slice
EOF

sudo mkdir -p /etc/sddm.conf.d
sudo mv /tmp/theme.conf /etc/sddm.conf.d
```

### 3.3 Install the GTK theme

1. Install NWG Look

```
yay -S nwg-look
```

2. Configure `Adwaita-dark` in the theme picket. To run the picker, bring up the runner modal with `SUPER+R` and choose `GTK Settings`.

---

## 4. System Configuration

### 4.1 Boot Options

These are options that need to be passed to the kernel at boot time. See the
bootloader docs for information on how to add these options.

For systemd-boot, which I use, they are located at `/boot/loader/entries/`. One
of the entries is the fallback, which should be left untouched.

#### Nvidia DRM

```text
nvidia_drm.modeset=1
```

*(Use this if you're using NVIDIA proprietary drivers, as per the Hyprland master tutorial.)*

#### ACPI Backlight control

For my Acer Nitro notebook, I need to add the following boot option so I can
control the device's built-in screen brightness with `brightnessctl`:

```
acpi_backlight=native
```

### 4.2 Dependencies

```bash
yay -S gnome-keyring seahorse
```

### 4.4 Systemd Services

Enable and start the following services:

```bash
# User services
for service in gcr-ssh-agent; do
  systemctl --user enable $service
  systemctl --user start $service
done

# System services
for service in bluetooth; do
  sudo systemctl enable $service
  sudo systemctl start $service
done
```

### 4.5 Cronjobs

Cronjobs are in the `cronjobs/` folder and can be deployed with rsync:

```
sudo rsync -va ./cronjobs/ /etc/
```

Current cronjobs are:

| Cronjob                 | Description                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cron.hourly/yay_pkglist | Takes an inventory of the packages manually installed with yay and writes it to `/etc/pkglist.txt` |

## 5. Further reading

These are documents that expand the documentation on this desktop environment

### 5.1 Keyboard shortcuts

[Keyboard shortcuts](KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md) documents all the possible keyboard
shortcuts. The information is extracted from hyprland configuration using
[Google's Gemini LLM](https://gemini.google.com).

### 5.2 Keyboard customizations

[Keyboard customizations](KEYBOARD_CUSTOMIZATIONS.md) documents the deployment
of xkeyboard-config compatible customizations that makes it easier to type in a
different language than that of the keyboard in use.

### 5.3 Backup and Restore

The [Backup and Restore](BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md) guide isn't intended to be
generally applicable outside my personal environment. It's there for my
personal disaster recovery drills, but could inspire others looking for backup
strategies.

### 5.4 Development

[This document](DEVELOPMENT.md) explains steps to install and configure
tools I need for daily work as a developer.
